# Reporting A Bug With DriveTools

If you ever find something that you think isn't working properly (if you're not sure you can try looking at the docs), then you should email me (`10tothe6`) at `full-auto-robots@gmail.com`! *Do not try reaching out any other way! I want to make sure all of the incoming reports go to the same place!*

Even if it's a small issue, the fact that it's there means I missed it so do let me know. I can't guarantee how fast issues will be fixed, but I'll get on it as soon as I can. I will NOT email you back once the issue has been fixed, so pay attention to the github released for an updated version. 

# Feature Requests/Ideas

Feel free to email me about feature ideas/requests as well, but there's a chance I won't listen either because it's too complicated or because I disagree with the feature. I *will* email you back in this case, either letting you know I'm working on it or that I won't be.
