# Field2D Displays

(image of what it looks like)

These are one of the most useful display objects that you can use. They allow you to see the position of the robot, show paths and shapes, and even send commands to the robot, telling it where to go. 

## Things to be familiar with:

* [robot programming](https://full-auto-robots.github.io/#dt_rob_about/) with DriveTools

* the [nav_robot](https://full-auto-robots.github.io/#dt_rob_nav_robot/) class
* the [nav_path](https://full-auto-robots.github.io/#dt_rob_nav_path/) class
* the [nav_field](https://full-auto-robots.github.io/#dt_rob_nav_field/) class

## Robots

If you read the page about the `nav_robot` class, then you'll know what kind of data you'll need, and if you've read the page on the `nav_field` class you'll know how to get that robot data up on NetworkTables.
