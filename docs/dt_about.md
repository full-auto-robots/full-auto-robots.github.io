# What's DriveTools?

DriveTools is a customizable FRC Dashboard (a program that allows you to display data coming in from an FRC robot). It's meant for use both in-house for testing and in-competition during matches.

It communicates with FRC robots using `NetworkTables` (specifically the `NT3` protocol). What is that? Find out [here](https://full-auto-robots.github.io/#dt_net_basics/) or [here](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/networktables/networktables-intro.html), more specifics [here](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/networktables/index.html). *Code examples are usually provided when talking about robot code, but it's always good to have background knowledge.*
