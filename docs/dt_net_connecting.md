# Connecting Drivetools to an FRC Robot

In order for Drivetools to connect, you first have to connect to the robot's wifi and make sure that the 'Communication' indicator on FRC Driverstation is green.
You don't have to have FRC Driverstation open, but I would recommend it.

From here, open Drivetools and enter the settings menu. Under 'Network' there are a bunch of fields that you need to make sure are correct.
First, the team number should be your FRC team number.

The server 'Server IP' should use the form "10.AB.CD.2" where ABCD is your team number. People who have spent a little time with robot networks should be familiar with this.
Once that's done, you should see the little connection indicator go from red to green.

You shouldn't need to re-launch Drivetools, or save anything. Just close the settings window, the software should connect automatically.
