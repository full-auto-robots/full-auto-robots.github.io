## Creating Display Objects

Just click the 'new display button' that looks like this:

Then, pick whatever type you want.

Originally Drivetools had a feature where you could view a list of keys that were currently on NetworkTables, 
and just click one of them to automatically spawn a node with the correct type and NT key already set. 
As convinient as this was, it was removed and WILL NOT BE RE-ADDED due to problems with the networking implementation that I cannot fix.

So anyone who has this idea, if you're reading this, yes I did already think about it.
