    <h1 id="whats-drivetools">What's DriveTools?</h1>
<p>DriveTools is a customizable FRC Dashboard (a program that allows you to display data coming in from an FRC robot). It's meant for use both in-house for testing and in-competition during matches.</p>
<p>Basically, it tries to combine the best of data visualization programs like AdvantageScope and dashboards like Elastic. The goal is to create a software that can do both, very effectively. A one-stop-shop for robot programming and driving.</p>
<p>It communicates with FRC robots using <code>NetworkTables</code> (specifically the <code>NT3</code> protocol). What is that? Find out <a href="https://full-auto-robots.github.io/#dt_net_basics/">here</a> or <a href="https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/networktables/networktables-intro.html">here</a>, more specifics <a href="https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/networktables/index.html">here</a>. <em>Code examples are usually provided when talking about robot code, but it's always good to have background knowledge.</em></p>
<h2 id="why-did-you-make-it">Why did you make it?</h2>
<p>I don't have a nice, clean answer to this question. I guess after realizing that a custom dashboard was within reach, I just wanted to try making one. So there, <em>curiosity</em> is the best answer I can give. All the rest I found out <em>after</em> I had already started.</p>
<p>Still, now that DriveTools exists I can do a lot more interesting things with FRC robots. It makes it easy to display stuff <em>other</em> than a single robot on the field display, which for one is very useful. That said I may have just not looked at other softwares that can do this.</p>
<h2 id="why-did-you-make-a-dashboard-with-a-game-engine">Why did you make a dashboard with a game engine?</h2>
<p>Right so the observant among you have realized that DriveTools was made with the Unity game engine. I did this for two reasons: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>One, I was already familiar with both it and C#, and the NetworkTables plugin I found worked with it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Two, I knew I wanted 3D functionality in DriveTools, and Unity had built-in 3D rendering. I hadn't written any 3D renderers by that time, and thought that was way further out of reach.</p>
</li>
</ul>
