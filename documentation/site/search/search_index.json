DriveTools is a customizable FRC Dashboard (a program that allows you to display data coming in from an FRC robot). It's meant for use both in-house for testing and in-competition during matches. Basically, it tries to combine the best of data visualization programs like AdvantageScope and dashboards like Elastic. The goal is to create a software that can do both, very effectively. A one-stop-shop for robot programming and driving. It communicates with FRC robots using NetworkTables (specifically the NT3 protocol). What is that? Find out here or here , more specifics here . Code examples are usually provided when talking about robot code, but it's always good to have background knowledge. Why did you make it? I don't have a nice, clean answer to this question. I guess after realizing that a custom dashboard was within reach, I just wanted to try making one. So there, curiosity is the best answer I can give. All the rest I found out after I had already started. Still, now that DriveTools exists I can do a lot more interesting things with FRC robots. It makes it easy to display stuff other than a single robot on the field display, which for one is very useful. That said I may have just not looked at other softwares that can do this. Why did you make a dashboard with a game engine? Right so the observant among you have realized that DriveTools was made with the Unity game engine. I did this for two reasons: One, I was already familiar with both it and C#, and the NetworkTables plugin I found worked with it. Two, I knew I wanted 3D functionality in DriveTools, and Unity had built-in 3D rendering. I hadn't written any 3D renderers by that time, and thought that was way further out of reach.","title":"About"},{"location":"dt_about/#whats-drivetools","text":"DriveTools is a customizable FRC Dashboard (a program that allows you to display data coming in from an FRC robot).

Instead of emailing me at full-auto-robots@gmail.com and explaning what you would add (do consider reaching out, I want this software to be as good as possible) you just want to make your own software. Fine. That's pretty much what I did when I made DriveTools in the first place. Read on, then. A word of warning Programming an FRC Dashboard from scratch is not easy. Unlike programming an FRC robot, nobody is giving you template projects that you can build off of and there are less people who are going to have the same problems as you. If you are an inexperienced software developer, I'd be weary of trying something like this out. It's not that I don't think it'll work as a learning experience. I actually think the opposite, diving into a project tends to teach you a lot (check out the old DriveTools to see the difference between my skills then and now). But notice how I said software developer , not coder ? If you want to make a dashboard and plan on publishing it, you've gotta make some smart decisions when designing it. Otherwise you'll hit roadblocks later. I'm not here to give a course on software design (I don't think I'm really qualified to, anyhow). If you're thinking about it, why not try it?

They can be used to visualize data coming from the bot, or upload data to the robot, or even command the robot by sending it coordinates. You could use them to see the position/rotation of the robot, show paths and shapes, things like that. Things to be familiar with: robot programming with DriveTools the nav_robot class the nav_path class the nav_field class Getting The Data Field2D displays can take in one of TWO data types from NetworkTables. Either a nav_robot by itself, or a whole nav_field class if you want to display more than a robot's position and rotation. In any case, just edit the display and set the NT Key to wherever your data class is located. Elements of A Field Robots If you read the page about the nav_robot class, then you'll know what kind of data you'll need. Field2D nodes have an array of nav_robot classes, which get turned into strings the same way that an individual nav_robot class would via nav_robot.EncodeToString(). This is done so that tracking multiple bots can be supported. Paths Field2D nodes have an array of nav_path classes as well. These can represent really whatever you want, as long as whatever you want is a collection of points in 3D space. Some ideas: * A trail showing where the robot has been * A visualization of an auto * Estimated positions of the robot (though you could use more nav_robot classes for this) Markers Field markers (the nav_marker class) represent things. They're just images that have a position, rotation, and scale. You can use them to represent Apriltags that the robot can see, game pieces that it has detected, or you can use them as ways to show events like an impact (which could ruin odometry). You can draw anything you want using nav_path classes, but using a nav_marker is usually quicker. The Field Editor As mentioned at the top of this page, Field2D nodes can also be used to send data as well as receive it. You do this by clicking the little pencil icon in the top left of the display, which opens the field editor . [image of editor button] This editor allows you to manually draw paths, place robots, or place markers on the field by clicking. Adding/Removing Field Elements Field elements of each type can be added by clicking the plus icon next to the name. You'll see an entry appear in the corresponding list for the new field element, and depending on what it is you can place it onto the field. For paths, creating a new path puts the editor into 'draw mode'. You click to place new path points, and either press 'Enter' or click the checkmark button to finish drawing the path. For robots/markers, just move your mouse to wherever you want to place it and left-click to place. Before you place it, you can use the scrollwheel to rotate it. After placing a field element you can change it via the list entry. Paths can be re-drawn and their color can be changed, robot settings can be edited, and so on. Removing a field element is as simple as clicking the red 'x' to the right of it's entry in the list. Uploading The Finished Field When finished, you can click the 'save' button. This will convert the field that you made into a string, and send it to NetworkTables. Now any code that you set up to read from that NetworkTables key can use the field data for whatever you want. Also, pressing the save button will tell Drivetools to save the data in the loaded layout (.lyt file) automatically. That way, closing and re-opening the software will preserve exactly the field in the editor. Not all NetworkTables data gets saved in the layout! It's only the data that you yourself pushed manually . Trying To Get/Receive Data At The Same Time ...just don't. Don't try this. When in the field editor the Field2D node will in theory ignore whatever's happening on NetworkTables, but it's better to not try and use the Field2D nodes as two-way, unless you really know what you're doing.","title":"Field2D Display"},{"location":"dt_dsp_field2d/#field2d-displays","text":"[image of what it looks like] These are one of the most useful display objects that you can use.
